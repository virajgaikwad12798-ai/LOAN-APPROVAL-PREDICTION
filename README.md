# LOAN-APPROVAL-PREDICTION-ANALYSIS PROJECT
Loan Approval Prediction :-
The Process involves collecting data such as applicant income,co-applicant income,credit history,loan amount,loan term,education,employment status,and property area.This data is first preprocessed by handling missing values,encoding categorical variables,and scaling numerical features if required
# ABOUT THE PROJECT
The Project is fully based predicting the data about the loan approved or reject.Based on the 1000 entries there is comparison on 'Age, Gender, Family income, Employment status, Marital status etc'. The dataset help us to understand the status of the customers loan approval or rejected status.
# IMPORTANT LIBRARIES REQUIRED FOR PREDICTING THE DATASET
Python,
Pandas,
Numpy,
