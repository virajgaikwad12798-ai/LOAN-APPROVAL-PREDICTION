Approval Prediction Dataset","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/supratimnag06/loan-approval-prediction-dataset/versions/1","description":"\uD83D\uDCCA Dataset Description\n\nThe dataset used for building the Loan Approval Prediction model consists of approximately 1,000 entries, each representing an individual loan application record. Every row corresponds to one applicant and contains information covering personal, financial, and professional attributes, along with the final decision on whether the loan was approved or rejected. The dataset is a mix of numerical and categorical variables, making it suitable for applying data preprocessing techniques such as encoding, scaling, and outlier handling before feeding it into machine learning models.\n\nKey personal attributes include demographic details such as Age, Gender, Marital_Status, Dependents, and Education_Level, which provide insight into the applicant\u2019s background. Financial attributes play a central role in decision-making and include features such as Applicant_Income, Coapplicant_Income, Credit_Score, DTI_Ratio (Debt-to-Income Ratio), Savings, Collateral_Value, Existing_Loans, Loan_Amount, and Loan_Term. These fields reflect the applicant\u2019s financial health, repayment ability, and overall risk profile. Additionally, professional and contextual attributes like Employment_Status, Employer_Category, Loan_Purpose, and Property_Area capture the employment type, loan intent, and socio-economic environment of the applicant.\n\nThe target column is Loan_Approved, which is a binary label indicating the outcome of the application: 1 for approved loans and 0 for rejected ones. The dataset shows a fairly realistic distribution, with both approved and rejected cases present, ensuring that the model learns to differentiate between high- and low-risk applicants.\n\nOverall, this dataset provides a comprehensive representation of the loan approval process, combining financial risk factors, socio-demographic information, and contextual details. Its diverse set of variables not only makes it ideal for supervised machine learning classification but also allows for deeper insights into the factors that significantly influence loan approvals."}
